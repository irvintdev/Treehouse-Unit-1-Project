        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I have worked for 3 years as a cook at a local restaurant. Started out as a waiter, but I quickly learned about every position and worked my way to the back of the house as a cook.</p>
        <p>Worked as a sales representative for a year at a department store.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I've done my share of school, but I have found that my experiences have taught me more than anything I learned at school.</p>
        <p>I love to learn and I always seek new information and I try to expand my knowledge of everything. For this reason, I'm excited to enter the field of web development where I will always be learning.</p>
